            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Rubayat Imran </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Dhaka, Bangladesh.</span>
            <br />
            I'm a Software Engineer who loves turning ideas into reality with code. Iâ€™ve got a good bit of experience creating custom websites using ReactJs, Redux, JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3.
            <br />
            I enjoy learning new things and keeping up with the latest in technology. My goal is always to deliver high-quality and efficient solutions that make a difference.
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
